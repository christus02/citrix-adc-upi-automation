# Citrix ADC Integration with UPI based deployments

Enterprise Kubernetes providers like OpenShift and Anthos mandates an External LB for load-balancing of Control plane and Compute Kubernetes nodes.

Citrix ADC (aka NetScaler) can be a right fit there. This automation provides a strong integration with the OpenShift and Anthos Installers so that Citrix ADC can be a Native External LB on such deployments.
